<h2>Rocket Financial</h2>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

Rocket Financial offers a multitude of services that target the average household. Rocket Financial offers home loans and consumer lines of credit. To capitalize on their fast-growing annual gross income potential, Rocket Financial sells ATMs to convenience stores throughout the New York Metropolitan area. We have developed a sales application for our sales team with updated price lists and percentages for home and personal loans, as well as new credit card options with low-cost introduction fees as low as $0, depending upon your credit history. Our marketing has opened up to now reach the entire New York Tri-State area. To achieve this, we created a new marketing application for Rocket Financial marketers to have monthly Financial Planning Parties to existing, new, and yet-to-be customers across the area. We have guest speakers and free financial advice from our team of Advisors. This event is fully automated with an email marketing campaign that discusses our new card and loan options. Additionally, our marketing campaign caters to business owners who are in need of an ATM service they can trust, that has competitive introductory set up costs and payment percentages per transaction, and has the option for monthly payments depending upon what works best for their business. The customers who choose Rocket Financial have peace if mind knowing they can trust our world Class customer service. Our customer service department is built upon customer satisfaction metrics designed to help guide our agents to better outcomes when resolving cases. Monthly competitions within the staff are held consistently to motivate the team members to high quality performance and generate healthy relationship building habits over time. However, for our business partners, there are situations that cannot be rectified with a simple email or phone call. In those situations, we at Rocket Financial deploy a trusted field service team member, experienced with the particular issue, directly to the service location once confirmation has been approved and time is scheduled.
